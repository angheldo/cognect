  	 <h1>Me, Myself, and I</h1>
         <p>My name is <b>Angel Louise Quitlong Doria</b>, 20 years old, from <b>Camaley Binmaley, Pangasinan</b>. Daughter of <b>Mr. Paulino Guarin Doria</b> and <b>Mrs. Maria Luisa Quitlong Doria</b>. I'm the eldest daughter. I am a student at the <b>Pangasinan State University</b>, a third year college student, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself here because the school is great. I am presently pursuing <b>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Major in Computer Information Technology</b>. I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate and always been trained to focus on my passion.</p>
         <p>I graduated from <a href="Camaley(CSS)">elementary</a> on the year 2013 when I was 12 years old. After, that I went on and also finished my <a href="BCS(CSS)">High School and Senior High</a> on 2019. I have many accomplishments during the latter part of my educational life, these are: <b>Top Honors Award Grade 12</b>; <b>Top Honors Award Senior High</b>; and <b>Member of Cheerdance Champion in 2019</b>. Now, I am on my <b>Third Year</b> of my <a href="PSU(CSS)">college</a> life as a <b>BS Math Student Major in Computer Information Technology</b>.</p>
         <p>My hobbies in life is watching movies, listening to music, reading stories, and sometimes I like to play video games like mobile legend. Also, as a student I like to make study notes for recitation, quizzes, and examinations. I am that type of a person that is resposible in every consequence of my decisions. Aside from that, when it comes to people, I prefer those that are optimistic, because they are confident in life and no matter what occurs,also, people who are humble and who care about others. One thing I hate about myself, is that I am inconsistent. In practically every aspect of my life, I have a bad habit of being inconsistent, and then I become an introvert for several weeks. I get angry at myself for no reason. And, also I am scared of the darkness, especially sleeping alone.</p>
